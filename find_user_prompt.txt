Please create me another Bash quiz script with a different find question.

Requirements

    One fenced code block only, labelled bash, containing the full script.

    Inside the script, use a here‑document (cat <<'EOF' > file_structure.txt … EOF) to write a small text file that shows the directory tree (or file list) the quiz will operate on.
    After writing it, the script should cat that file so the learner can see the data it describes, then create the matching files/directories in a temporary folder for the find command to run against.

    Follow the same quiz structure as before (options A–D, read user input, give ✅/❌ feedback, play the sound on success).

    Pick a find concept that is different from simply “search files by name ( -name '*.txt' )”; e.g. filtering by size (-size), modification time (-mtime), permissions (-perm), depth control (-maxdepth/-mindepth), pruning (-prune), running commands with -exec, etc.

    Keep the question and correct answer clear in the feedback message.

Enclose the entire Bash script in one triple‑backtick block like:
#!/bin/bash

set -x
cat file_structure.txt
set +x

# Build the sample directory tree described in file_structure.txt
mkdir -p sandbox/{logs,archive}
touch sandbox/logs/{app.log,server.log}
touch sandbox/archive/{old1.log,old2.txt}

echo "The output we want is:"
find sandbox -type f -name '*.log' -maxdepth 2 -mtime +365
echo "Which of these commands would produce that output?"
echo "A: find sandbox -name '*.log' -type f -mtime +365"
echo "B: find sandbox -type f -name '*.log' -maxdepth 2 -mtime +365"
echo "C: find sandbox -type f -mtime +365 -maxdepth 2 -name '*.log'"
echo "D: find sandbox -maxdepth 2 -type f -name '*.log' -mtime -365"

read -p 'Enter your answer (A/B/C/D): ' answer

if [ "$answer" == "B" ]; then
    echo '✅ Correct! Well done.'
    paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga &
else
    echo "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer is B: find sandbox -type f -name '*.log' -maxdepth 2 -mtime +365"
fi
